## Running the memey countdown timer

This repository contains a small Python script that opens a window and shows how much time is left until the end of the workday. The end time is configured for 17:00 by default.

Run it with:

```
python memetime.py
```

The interface is intentionally "memey" with bright colors and silly text.

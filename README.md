## Running the memey countdown timer

This repository contains a small Python script that opens a window and shows how much time is left until the end of the workday. The end time is configured for 17:00 by default.

Run it with:

```
python memetime.py
```

The interface is intentionally "memey" with bright colors and silly text.
Now it also displays a small pixel-art cat for extra cuteness.

## Running the pink cat timer

If you prefer a calmer look with a gentle pink background and white digits, run:

```
python cat_timer.py
```

This alternative timer keeps the cute pixel cat but uses softer colors. It now
counts down to the end of a 6:00â€“18:00 shift by default and shows the cat at the
bottom of the window. The cat blinks and is drawn with more detail along with
additional pixel art (a heart and a ball of yarn). You can change the
end-of-day time with the small input fields under the timer.
